/lcreate

/lot [<playername>]
    Without the playername, this command will show the information of the Lot that you are currently standing in, if any.
    With the playername, this command will show the number of Lots owned by the player and their respective IDs.

/ljumpset <LotID>
    This command gets the player's location sets the jump location for the Lot.
    The jump location is used when going to Lots with /gotolot or /mylot.

/gotolot [<playername>] <LotID>
    Without the playername, this command will jump the player to the Lot with the GLOBAL* ID specified, if the Lot has a jump location.
    With the playername, this command will jump the player to the Lot with the LOCAL* ID specified belonging to playername, if the Lot has a jump location.

/lotallow [<LotID>] <playername>
    Lotallow will allow for other players to build on your Lots.
    If the player is standing in a Lot that they own, this command can be used without the LotID argument.
    Although if the player includes the LotID, player allows playername to build in that Lot.

/lotdeny [<LotID>] <playername>
    Lotdeny removes players that have been allowed on Lots.
    See /lotallow for command structure.

/mylot <LotID>
    This command will jump the player to the Lot with the LOCAL* ID of LotID.
    This is the same as /gotolot YOURNAME <LotID>.


*GLOBAL IDs are unique to each Lot. While LOCAL IDs are specific to the player. Both are seen when the Lot is created and with the command /lot when over a Lot.
